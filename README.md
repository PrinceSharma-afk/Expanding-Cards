# Expanding Cards

This project demonstrates a responsive user interface featuring interactive expanding panels implemented with CSS Flexbox and transitions. Each panel displays a background image with an overlay and a hidden title that becomes visible when the panel is active (clicked). The active panel expands smoothly to draw focus, while other panels contract proportionally.
